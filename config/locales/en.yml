They encountered many obstacles on the path to success despite having the passion, determination, and vision. The main barrier to success, they discovered, was a lack of funding opportunities to take their passions to the next level.<br><br>Jampoff was born when our founder reached out to a good friend to aid him in realizing his dream. This artist was talented and passionate about his craft but became stuck when trying to bring his talents to reality. <br><br>Our founder noticed a parallel between him and his friend in attempting to realize their goals: the lack of funding. He sought to fix this by introducing a platform where his friend and all artists can realize their dreams and aspirations."
